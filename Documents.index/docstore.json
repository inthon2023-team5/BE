Some of its key features include:\n\n- Document Retrieval: Langchain allows you to retrieve relevant documents based on a given query. This feature is useful for building search engines and information retrieval systems.\n\n- Text Embeddings: Langchain can generate vector representations (embeddings) of text. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and can be used for tasks such as text classification and clustering.\n\n- Question-Answering: Langchain provides a question-answering functionality that can answer questions based on a set of documents. This feature is valuable for building intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n- Support for Multiple File Formats: Langchain supports loading documents from various file formats, including JSON, CSV, TXT, and PDF. This flexibility makes it easy to work with different types of data.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":9}}}}],["17",{"pageContent":"- Vector Store: Langchain allows you to create and manage vector stores, which are collections of vector embeddings.
